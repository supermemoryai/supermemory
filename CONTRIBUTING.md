# Contributing to Supermemory

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Supermemory! We welcome contributions from developers of all skill levels. This guide will help you get started with contributing to our AI-powered memory layer API.

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Bun** (>= 1.2.17) - Our preferred package manager
- **Git** for version control

### Setting Up the Development Environment

1. **Fork and clone the repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/supermemory.git
   cd supermemory
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**

   ```bash
   bun install
   ```

3. **Set Up Environment Variables**

   ```bash
   # Copy the example environment file
   cp .env.example .env.local

   # Edit the file with your configuration
   # You'll need to add your API keys and database URLs
   ```

4. **Start the Development Server**

   ```bash
   bun run dev
   ```

   This will start all applications in the monorepo. The web app will be available at `http://localhost:3000`.

## 📁 Project Structure

Supermemory is organized as a monorepo using Turbo:

```
supermemory/
├── apps/
│   └── web/                 # Next.js web application
├── packages/
│   ├── ui/                  # Shared UI components
│   ├── lib/                 # Shared utilities and logic
│   ├── hooks/               # Shared React hooks
│   ├── validation/          # Zod schemas and validation
│   ├── eslint-config/       # ESLint configurations
│   └── typescript-config/   # TypeScript configurations
└── turbo.json              # Turbo configuration
```

## 🛠️ Development Workflow

### Available Scripts

- `bun run dev` - Start development servers for all apps
- `bun run build` - Build all applications
- `bun run format-lint` - Format and lint code using Biome
- `bun run check-types` - Type check all packages

### Code Quality

We use several tools to maintain code quality:

- **Biome** for linting and formatting
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **Turbo** for build optimization

Before submitting a PR, ensure your code passes all checks:

```bash
bun run format-lint
bun run check-types
bun run build
```

### Tech Stack

- **Frontend**: Next.js 15, React 19, TypeScript
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS, Radix UI components
- **State Management**: Zustand, TanStack Query
- **Build Tool**: Turbo (monorepo)
- **Package Manager**: Bun
- **Deployment**: Cloudflare (OpenNext.js)

## 🎯 How to Contribute

### Types of Contributions

We welcome various types of contributions:

- 🐛 **Bug fixes**
- ✨ **New features**
- 🎨 **UI/UX enhancements**
- ⚡ **Performance optimizations**

### Finding Issues to Work On

1. Check our [Issues](https://github.com/supermemoryai/supermemory/issues) page
2. Look for issues labeled `good first issue` for beginners
3. Issues labeled `help wanted` are great for contributors
4. Feel free to propose new features by opening an issue first

### Making Changes

1. **Create a Branch**

   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   # or
   git checkout -b fix/your-bug-fix
   ```

2. **Make Your Changes**
   - Follow our coding standards (see below)
   - Write clear, concise commit messages
   - Add tests if applicable
   - Update documentation if needed

3. **Test Your Changes**
   ```bash
   bun run dev          # Test locally
   bun run build        # Ensure it builds
   bun run format-lint  # Check formatting
   bun run check-types  # Check types
   ```

## 📝 Coding Standards

### General Guidelines

- Use **TypeScript** for all new code
- Follow the existing code style and patterns
- Write self-documenting code with clear variable names
- Add JSDoc comments for complex functions
- Keep functions small and focused

### Component Guidelines

- Use functional components with hooks
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Extract reusable logic into custom hooks
- Use proper TypeScript types for props

### File Naming

- Use `kebab-case` for file names
- Use `PascalCase` for component files
- Use `camelCase` for utility functions

### Import Organization

```typescript
// 1. React and Next.js imports
import React from 'react';
import { NextPage } from 'next';

// 2. Third-party libraries
import { clsx } from 'clsx';
import { motion } from 'motion';

// 3. Internal packages
import { Button } from '@repo/ui';
import { useAuth } from '@repo/lib';

// 4. Relative imports
import { Header } from './header';
import { Footer } from './footer';
```

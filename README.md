## 👀 What is this?

Supermemory exists to bring contextual knowledge to the age of LLMs. 
The vision is to be the universal engine for memory

LLMs are smart as fuck. but giving them the right context make them even more useful in most contexts.

Think about it - there’s countless use-cases where LLMs by themselves don’t do much, but giving them the right data can make it a magical experience.

Right data comes from everywhere. it’s literally with us. at all times. everything we see, hear, touch. is good data, USEFUL data. but then it all comes down to “how can i search for something within this pool of awesome stuff?”

We make the pool, and give the search tools.

That’s literally all Supermemory does. Every single project in our scope aids in doing one of the two things.

Whether it’s organizing personal information, enhancing applications with contextual intelligence, or enabling companies to centralize and retrieve internal knowledge, Supermemory becomes the core infrastructure for transforming scattered data into actionable insights.

Yes, everything is free & open source.
Supermemory is built by [me](https://dhravya.dev), a college student. My life situations make it very difficult and almost impossible to monetise the product.

Any kind of sponsorships / support would mean a lot to me, and help me keep supermemory alive.

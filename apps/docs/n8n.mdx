Connect Supermemory to your n8n workflows to build intelligent automation workflows and agents that leverage your full knowledge base.

## Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- n8n instance (self-hosted or cloud)
- Supermemory API key ([get one here](https://console.supermemory.com/settings))
- Basic understanding of n8n workflows

### Setting Up the HTTP Request Node

The Supermemory integration in n8n uses the HTTP Request node to interact with the Supermemory API. Here's how to configure it:

1. Add an **HTTP Request** node to your workflow (Core > HTTP Request)

2. Set the **Method** to `POST`
3. Set the **URL** to the appropriate Supermemory API endpoint:
   - Add memory: `https://api.supermemory.ai/v3/documents`
   - Search memories: `https://api.supermemory.ai/v4/search`
4. For authentication, select **Generic Credential Type** and then **Bearer Auth**
5. Click on **Create New Credential** and paste the Supermemory API Key in the Bearer Token field.

6. Check **Send Body** and select **JSON** as the Body Content Type. The fields depend on what API endpoint you're sending the request to. You can find detailed step-by-step examples below.

## Step-by-Step Tutorial

In this tutorial, we'll create a workflow that automatically adds every email from Gmail to your Supermemory knowledge base. We'll use the HTTP Request node to send email data to Supermemory's API, creating a searchable archive of all your communications.

### Adding Gmail Emails to Supermemory

Follow these steps to build a workflow that captures and stores your Gmail messages:

#### Step 1: Set Up Gmail Trigger

1. **Add a Gmail Trigger node** to your workflow
2. Configure your Gmail credentials (OAuth2 recommended)
3. Set the trigger to **Message Received**
4. Optional: Add labels or filters to process specific emails only

#### Step 2: Configure HTTP Request Node

1. **Add an HTTP Request node** after the Gmail Trigger
2. **Method**: `POST`
3. **URL**: [`https://api.supermemory.ai/v3/documents`](/api-reference/manage-documents/add-document)
4. Select your auth credentials you created with the Supermemory API Key.

#### Step 3: Format Email Data for Supermemory

In the HTTP Request node's **Body**, select **JSON** and **Using Fields Below**

And create 2 fields:

1. name: `content`, value: `{{ $json.snippet }}`
2. name: `containerTag`, value: gmail

#### Step 4: Handle Attachments (Optional)

If you want to process attachments:

1. **Add a Loop node** after the Gmail Trigger
2. Loop through `{{$json.attachments}}`
3. **Add a Gmail node** to download each attachment
4. **Add another HTTP Request node** to store attachment metadata


#### Step 5: Add Error Handling

1. **Add an Error Trigger node** connected to your workflow
2. Configure it to catch errors from the HTTP Request node
3. **Add a notification node** (Email, Slack, etc.) to alert you of failures
4. Optional: Add a **Wait node** with retry logic

#### Step 6: Test Your Workflow

1. **Activate the workflow** in test mode
2. Send a test email to your Gmail account
3. Check the execution to ensure the email was captured
4. Verify in Supermemory that the email appears in search results

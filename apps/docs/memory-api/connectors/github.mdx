---

Supermemory syncs GitHub content automatically and instantaneously via webhooks.

## Supported content types

- **Repositories**: README files, documentation, and code comments
- **Issues**: Issue descriptions, comments, and labels
- **Pull Requests**: PR descriptions, comments, and review discussions
- **Discussions**: GitHub Discussions posts and comments
- **Wikis**: Repository wiki pages and documentation

## Document types

GitHub content is identified with these types:
- `github_repo` - Repository READMEs and documentation
- `github_issue` - Issues and their comments
- `github_pr` - Pull requests and their comments
- `github_discussion` - GitHub Discussions
- `github_wiki` - Repository wiki pages

## Conversions

To import items, supermemory converts GitHub content into markdown, and then ingests them into supermemory. This conversion is lossy, and some formatting may be lost.

## Sync frequency

Supermemory syncs GitHub documents:
- **A document is modified or created (Webhook received)**
    - GitHub documents are synced instantaneously via webhooks
- Every **four hours** (scheduled sync)
- On **Manual Sync** (API call)
    - You can call `/v3/connections/github/sync` to sync documents manually

## OAuth scopes required

GitHub OAuth application requires these scopes:
- `repo` - Access to private repositories
- `read:org` - Read organization membership
- `read:user` - Read user profile data
- `read:discussion` - Read repository discussions

## Webhook events

GitHub webhooks are automatically configured for:
- `push` - Repository pushes and commits
- `issues` - Issue opened, closed, edited
- `pull_request` - PR opened, closed, merged
- `discussion` - Discussion created, edited, answered
- `gollum` - Wiki page created or edited

## Repository access

- **Public repositories**: Automatically accessible
- **Private repositories**: Requires user to grant access
- **Organization repositories**: Requires organization approval
- **Forked repositories**: Only synced if user has write access

## Content filtering

You can configure which content to sync using the settings API:

```typescript
await client.settings.update({
  githubSyncIssues: true,
  githubSyncPRs: true,
  githubSyncDiscussions: true,
  githubSyncWiki: true,
  githubRepositories: [
    'owner/repo1',
    'owner/repo2'
  ]
});
```

## Rate limits

GitHub API rate limits apply:
- **Authenticated requests**: 5,000 requests per hour
- **Webhook events**: No rate limit
- **Large repositories**: May take time for initial sync

## Security considerations

- OAuth tokens are encrypted and stored securely
- Webhook secrets are validated for security
- Repository access is scoped to user permissions
- Content is processed in isolated environments

supermemory can sync external connections like Google Drive, Notion, OneDrive with more coming soon.

### The Flow

1. Make a `POST` request to `/v3/connections/{provider}`
2. supermemory will return an `authLink` which you can redirect the user to
3. The user will be redirected to the provider's login page
4. User is redirected back to your app's `redirectUrl`

## Sync frequency

supermemory syncs documents:
- **A document is modified or created (Webhook recieved)**
    - Note that not all providers are synced via webhook (Instant sync right now)
    - `Google-Drive` and `Notion` documents are synced instantaneously
- Every **four hours**
- On **Manual Sync** (API call)
    - You can call `/v3/connections/{provider}/sync` to sync documents manually

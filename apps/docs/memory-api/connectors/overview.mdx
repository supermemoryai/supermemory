supermemory can sync external connections like Google Drive, Notion, OneDrive, and Web Crawler.

### The Flow

For OAuth-based connectors (Notion, Google Drive, OneDrive):
1. Make a `POST` request to `/v3/connections/{provider}`
2. supermemory will return an `authLink` which you can redirect the user to
3. The user will be redirected to the provider's login page
4. User is redirected back to your app's `redirectUrl`

For Web Crawler:
1. Make a `POST` request to `/v3/connections/web-crawler` with `startUrl` in metadata
2. Connection is established immediately (no OAuth required)
3. Crawling begins automatically

## Sync frequency

supermemory syncs documents:
- **A document is modified or created (Webhook received)**
    - Note that not all providers are synced via webhook (Instant sync right now)
    - `Google-Drive` and `Notion` documents are synced instantaneously
    - `Web-Crawler` uses scheduled recrawling instead of webhooks
- Every **four hours** (for OAuth-based connectors)
- **Scheduled recrawling** (for Web Crawler - sites recrawled if not synced in 7+ days)
- On **Manual Sync** (API call)
    - You can call `/v3/connections/{provider}/sync` to sync documents manually

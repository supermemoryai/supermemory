## What is Memory Graph?

Memory Graph is a React component that visualizes your Supermemory documents and memories as an interactive network. Documents appear as rectangular nodes, memories as hexagonal nodes, and connections between them show relationships and similarity.

The graph renders using Canvas 2D, providing smooth interactions with hundreds of nodes through pan, zoom, and drag operations.

## When to Use It

Use Memory Graph when you need to:

- **Visualize knowledge graphs** - Show how documents and memories connect
- **Navigate memory spaces** - Filter and browse by workspace or tag
- **Create memory browsers** - Give users a visual overview of their stored content

## Performance

The graph handles hundreds of nodes efficiently through:
- Canvas-based rendering (not DOM elements)
- Viewport culling (only draws visible nodes)
- Level-of-detail optimization (simplifies rendering when zoomed out)
- Change-based rendering (only redraws when state changes)
- Throttled viewport calculations

For very large datasets (1000+ documents), use pagination to load data in chunks.

## Browser Support

Works in all modern browsers that support:
- Canvas 2D API
- ES2020 JavaScript
- CSS custom properties

Tested on Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge (latest versions).

[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/@supermemory/memory-graph.svg)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@supermemory/memory-graph)

The `@supermemory/memory-graph` package provides an interactive, high-performance visualization component that transforms your documents and memories into an explorable knowledge graph. Built with React and powered by HTML5 Canvas, it offers smooth interactions and sophisticated rendering optimizations.

## When to Use

The graph visualization component is ideal for:

- **Knowledge Management Dashboards**: Visualize how documents and memories connect
- **Document Explorers**: Let users navigate through related content visually
- **Memory Analytics**: Show patterns in how information is structured and related
- **Search Result Visualization**: Display search results in context of the broader knowledge graph

## Variants

The component offers two visual variants optimized for different use cases:

| Variant | Initial Zoom | Spaces Selector | Legend Position | Best For |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|-----------------|----------|
| **Console** | 0.8 (closer) | Shown | Bottom-right | Full-page dashboards, admin panels |
| **Consumer** | 0.5 (wider) | Hidden | Top-right | Embedded widgets, sidebars |

## Graph Elements

The visualization displays three types of nodes and three types of connections:

**Nodes**:
- **Documents**: Rendered as rounded rectangles with glassmorphism styling
- **Memory Entries**: Rendered as hexagons (or circles when zoomed out)
- **Status Indicators**: Visual markers for forgotten, expiring, and new memories

**Connections**:
- **Doc-Memory**: Solid thin lines connecting documents to their memory chunks
- **Doc-Doc**: Dashed lines showing semantic similarity (threshold: 0.725)
- **Version Chains**: Double-line arrows showing memory evolution (updates/extends/derives)

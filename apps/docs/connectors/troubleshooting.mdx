Quick guide to resolve common connector issues with authentication, syncing, and permissions.

## Quick Health Check

Check if your connectors are working properly:

<CodeGroup>

```typescript TypeScript
const connections = await client.connections.list({
  containerTags: ['user-123']
});

connections.forEach(conn => {
  console.log(`${conn.provider}: ${conn.email} - Connected ${conn.createdAt}`);
});

// Check for stuck documents
const documents = await client.connections.listDocuments('notion', {
  containerTags: ['user-123']
});

const failed = documents.filter(doc => doc.status === 'failed');
if (failed.length > 0) {
  console.log(`⚠️ ${failed.length} documents failed to sync`);
}
```

```python Python
connections = client.connections.list(container_tags=['user-123'])

for conn in connections:
    print(f"{conn.provider}: {conn.email} - Connected {conn.created_at}")

# Check for stuck documents
documents = client.connections.list_documents(
    'notion',
    container_tags=['user-123']
)

failed = [doc for doc in documents if doc.status == 'failed']
if failed:
    print(f"⚠️ {len(failed)} documents failed to sync")
```

```bash cURL
# List all connections
curl -X POST "https://api.supermemory.ai/v3/connections/list" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $SUPERMEMORY_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"containerTags": ["user-123"]}'

# Check document status
curl -X POST "https://api.supermemory.ai/v3/documents/list" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $SUPERMEMORY_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"containerTags": ["user-123"], "source": "notion"}'
```

## Common Issues

### OAuth Callback Fails

**Problem:** "Invalid redirect URI" error after user grants permissions

**Solution:** Ensure your redirect URL matches EXACTLY what's configured in your OAuth app:

```typescript
// correct - exact match with OAuth app settings
const connection = await client.connections.create('notion', {
  redirectUrl: 'https://yourapp.com/auth/notion/callback',
  containerTags: ['user-123']
});

// Wrong - URL doesn't match
// redirectUrl: 'https://yourapp.com/callback'
```

**Prevention:**
- Use HTTPS for production URLs
- Copy the exact URL from your OAuth app settings
- Test the flow in development first

### Documents Not Syncing

**Problem:** Documents stuck in "queued" or "extracting" status for over 30 minutes

**Solution:** Trigger a manual sync:

```typescript
// Force sync for stuck documents
await client.connections.import('notion', {
  containerTags: ['user-123']
});
```

If documents consistently fail:
- Check if files are over 50MB (may timeout)
- Verify you have permission to access the documents
- Ensure the document type is supported

### Permission Denied Errors

**Problem:** Some documents show "permission denied" or aren't syncing

**Solution:** Re-authenticate with proper permissions:

```typescript
// Delete and recreate connection
await client.connections.deleteByProvider('google-drive', {
  containerTags: ['user-123']
});

const newConnection = await client.connections.create('google-drive', {
  redirectUrl: 'https://yourapp.com/callback',
  containerTags: ['user-123']
});

// User must re-authenticate
window.location.href = newConnection.authLink;
```

### Sync Takes Too Long

**Problem:** Hundreds of documents taking hours to sync

**Solution:** Set reasonable document limits:

```typescript
const connection = await client.connections.create('onedrive', {
  redirectUrl: 'https://yourapp.com/callback',
  containerTags: ['user-123'],
  documentLimit: 500  // Start with fewer documents
});
```

## Provider-Specific Issues

### Google Drive

**Shared Drive Issues**

Shared drives require special permissions. Make sure:
- User has access to the shared drive
- OAuth app has drive.readonly scope
- User is a member of the shared drive

### Notion

**Database Not Syncing**

Notion databases need explicit permission. If databases aren't syncing:

1. Go to Notion workspace settings
2. Find your integration under "Connections"
3. Click on the integration
4. Select specific pages/databases to share
5. Re-sync after granting access

**Workspace Access**

For full workspace access, a workspace admin must:
1. Approve the integration
2. Grant access to all pages
3. Enable "Read content" permission

### OneDrive

**Business vs Personal Accounts**

Business accounts may have additional restrictions:
- Admin consent might be required
- Some SharePoint sites may be restricted
- Compliance policies may block certain files


## Best Practices

1. **Set reasonable document limits** - Start with 500-1000 documents
2. **Use descriptive container tags** - Makes debugging easier
3. **Monitor failed documents** - Check weekly for sync issues
4. **Handle rate limits gracefully** - Implement exponential backoff
5. **Test OAuth in development** - Ensure redirect URLs work before production

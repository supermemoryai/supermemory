## 1. Run Your First Benchmark

```bash
bun run src/index.ts run -p supermemory -b longmemeval -j gpt-4o -r my-first-run
```

## 2. View Results

### Option A: Web UI

```bash
bun run src/index.ts serve
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to see results visually.

### Option B: CLI

```bash
# Check run status
bun run src/index.ts status -r my-first-run

# View failed questions for debugging
bun run src/index.ts show-failures -r my-first-run
```

## 3. Compare Providers

Run the same benchmark across multiple providers:

```bash
bun run src/index.ts compare -p supermemory,mem0,zep -b locomo -j gpt-4o
```

Results are saved to `data/runs/{runId}/report.json`.

## Sample Output

```json
{
  "accuracy": 0.72,
  "accuracyByType": {
    "single-hop": 0.85,
    "multi-hop": 0.65,
    "temporal": 0.70,
    "adversarial": 0.68
  },
  "avgLatency": 1250,
  "totalQuestions": 50
}
```

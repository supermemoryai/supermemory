## Prerequisites

- [Bun](https://bun.sh) runtime installed
- API keys for providers and LLM judges you want to use

## Install MemoryBench

```bash
git clone https://github.com/supermemoryai/memorybench
cd memorybench
bun install
```

## Configure API Keys

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory:

```bash
# Memory Providers (add keys for providers you want to test)
SUPERMEMORY_API_KEY=your_key
MEM0_API_KEY=your_key
ZEP_API_KEY=your_key

# LLM Judges (at least one required)
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key
ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your_key
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_key
```

<Note>
You only need API keys for the providers and judges you plan to use. For example, to benchmark Supermemory with GPT-4o as judge, you only need `SUPERMEMORY_API_KEY` and `OPENAI_API_KEY`.
</Note>

```bash
bun run src/index.ts help
```

You should see the list of available commands.

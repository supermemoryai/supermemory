## Organization Settings

Organization settings allow you to customize and configure various aspects of your Supermemory workspace, including custom OAuth credentials for connectors, processing options, and analytics preferences.

## Custom OAuth Credentials

Supermemory provides default OAuth credentials for various connectors, but you can configure custom credentials for your organization to use your own OAuth applications. This gives you more control over the authentication flow and allows you to customize the OAuth app settings.

### Why Use Custom OAuth Credentials?

- **Branding**: Use your own OAuth app with custom branding and app information
- **Rate Limits**: Avoid shared rate limits by using your own OAuth application
- **Control**: Full control over OAuth app settings, permissions, and configurations
- **Compliance**: Meet specific compliance requirements for your organization

### Supported Connectors

You can configure custom OAuth credentials for the following connectors:

- **Google Drive**: Custom Google OAuth Client ID and Secret
- **Notion**: Custom Notion OAuth Client ID and Secret
- **OneDrive**: Custom Microsoft OAuth Client ID and Secret
- **GitHub**: Custom GitHub OAuth Client ID and Secret

## Configuring Custom GitHub OAuth Credentials

To use custom GitHub OAuth credentials for your organization:

### Step 1: Create a GitHub OAuth App

1. Go to [GitHub Developer Settings](https://github.com/settings/developers)
2. Click **OAuth Apps** → **New OAuth App**
3. Fill in the application details:
   - **Application name**: Your app name (e.g., "My Company - Supermemory")
   - **Homepage URL**: Your organization's homepage
   - **Authorization callback URL**: `https://api.supermemory.ai/auth/github/callback`
4. Click **Register application**
5. Note your **Client ID** (displayed on the app page)
6. Click **Generate a new client secret** and save the secret securely

### Step 2: Configure in Supermemory

1. Navigate to **Advanced Settings** in your Supermemory dashboard
2. Find the **GitHub** connector section
3. Toggle **Use custom client keys** to enable
4. Enter your **Client ID** and **Client Secret**
5. Click **Save Changes**

### Validation Requirements

When configuring custom GitHub OAuth credentials, the following validation rules apply:

**Client ID:**
- Must be at least 10 characters long
- Must be less than 50 characters
- Can only contain letters, numbers, dots, underscores, and hyphens

**Client Secret:**
- Must be exactly 40 characters long
- Must be a hexadecimal string (only contains 0-9 and a-f)

<Note>
Your Client Secret is encrypted before being stored in the database and is never displayed in plain text after saving.
</Note>

## Other Organization Settings

### Processing Settings

- **LLM Filtering**: Enable AI-powered filtering of content before processing
- **Chunk Size**: Configure the maximum chunk size for document processing

### Analytics

Configure analytics and monitoring preferences for your organization. See [Analytics & Monitoring](/docs/analytics) for more details.

## Security

All sensitive credentials (OAuth secrets, API keys) are encrypted at rest using industry-standard encryption. Credentials are only decrypted when needed for authentication flows and are never exposed in API responses or logs.

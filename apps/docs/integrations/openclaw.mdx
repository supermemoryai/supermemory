<Warning>
This integration requires the **Supermemory Pro plan**. [Upgrade here](https://console.supermemory.ai/billing).
</Warning>

[OpenClaw](https://github.com/supermemoryai/openclaw-supermemory) is a multi-platform AI messaging gateway that connects to WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, Slack, iMessage, and other messaging channels. The Supermemory plugin gives OpenClaw memory across every channel.

## Install the Plugin

Get started by installing the plugin with a single command.

```bash
openclaw plugins install @supermemory/openclaw-supermemory
```

Restart OpenClaw after installing.

## Setup

Run the setup command and enter your API key when prompted.

```bash
openclaw supermemory setup
```

Enter your API key from [console.supermemory.ai](https://console.supermemory.ai). That's it.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Advanced Setup">
    Configure all options interactively with the advanced setup command:

    ```bash
    openclaw supermemory setup-advanced
    ```

    This lets you configure: container tag, auto-recall, auto-capture, capture mode, custom container tags, and more.

    See [Configuration Options](#configuration-options) for all available settings.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## How It Works

Once installed, the plugin runs automatically with zero interaction.

- **Auto-Recall** — Before every AI turn, Supermemory is queried for relevant memories and the user's profile. These are injected as context so the AI sees preferences, facts, and semantically similar past conversations.
- **Auto-Capture** — After every AI turn, the conversation exchange is sent to Supermemory for extraction and long-term storage. Supermemory handles deduplication and profile building.
- **Custom Container Tags** — When enabled via advanced setup, define custom memory containers (e.g., `work`, `personal`, `bookmarks`). The AI automatically picks the right container based on your instructions.

## Features

### AI Tools

The AI can use these tools autonomously during conversations.

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `supermemory_store` | Save information to long-term memory. |
| `supermemory_search` | Search memories by query with similarity scores. |
| `supermemory_forget` | Delete a memory by query or ID. |
| `supermemory_profile` | View the user profile — persistent facts and recent context. |

### Slash Commands

Users can interact with memory directly in chat.

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/remember [text]` | Manually save something to memory. |
| `/recall [query]` | Search memories and see results with similarity scores. |

### CLI Commands

Manage your memory from the terminal.

```bash
openclaw supermemory setup              # Configure API key
openclaw supermemory setup-advanced     # Configure all options
openclaw supermemory status             # View current configuration
openclaw supermemory search <query>     # Search memories
openclaw supermemory profile            # View user profile
openclaw supermemory wipe               # Delete all memories (requires confirmation)
```

## FAQ

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do I install OpenClaw with Supermemory?">
    1. Install the plugin:

    ```bash
    openclaw plugins install @supermemory/openclaw-supermemory
    ```

    2. Run the setup wizard:

    ```bash
    openclaw supermemory setup
    ```

    3. When prompted, paste your API key from [console.supermemory.ai](https://console.supermemory.ai). The key starts with `sm_`.

    4. Restart OpenClaw to activate the plugin:

    ```bash
    openclaw gateway --force
    ```

    5. Verify the connection:

    ```bash
    openclaw supermemory status
    ```

    That's it — Supermemory is now connected and will automatically recall and capture memories across all your channels.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="I have Twitter bookmarks in a separate container. How do I use them with Supermemory?">
    Use the advanced setup to enable custom container tags and add a read-only Twitter bookmarks container.

    ```bash
    openclaw supermemory setup-advanced
    ```

    When prompted, enter:

    - **API key**: paste your `sm_` key
    - **Container tag**: keep the default (or set your preferred root tag)
    - **Auto recall**: `true` (recommended)
    - **Auto capture**: `true`
    - **Enable custom container tags**: `true`
    - **Custom container tags**: `twitter-bookmarks:Twitter bookmarks saved from Twitter`

    <Tip>
    Custom container tags use the format `tag:description`, separated by a colon. For example: `twitter-bookmarks:Twitter bookmarks saved from Twitter`.
    </Tip>

    When asked for **custom container instructions**, enter something like:

    ```
    Whenever the user asks about Twitter bookmarks, search the twitter-bookmarks container.
    Never save anything to the twitter-bookmarks container — it is read-only and populated directly from Twitter.
    ```

    This ensures the AI references your Twitter bookmarks when relevant but never writes to that container.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I separate work (Slack + Gmail) and personal (Telegram + WhatsApp) memories?">
    Use custom container tags to route memories by channel. Run the advanced setup:

    ```bash
    openclaw supermemory setup-advanced
    ```

    When prompted, enter:

    - **API key**: paste your `sm_` key
    - **Container tag**: keep the default
    - **Auto recall**: `true`
    - **Auto capture**: `true`
    - **Enable custom container tags**: `true`
    - **Custom container tags**:
      - `work:Work-related memories from Slack and Gmail`
      - `personal:Personal memories from Telegram and WhatsApp`

    When asked for **custom container instructions**, enter:

    ```
    When the active channel is slack or gmail, always use the work container for storing and recalling memories. Never mix personal memories into work context.

    When the active channel is telegram or whatsapp, always use the personal container. Do not recall or store work memories in personal conversations.
    ```

    This keeps your work and personal memories completely separated — Slack and Gmail conversations only see `work` memories, while Telegram and WhatsApp only see `personal` memories.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="I'm not technical. How can I set up advanced mode?">
    Ask the OpenClaw agent directly in any chat. No terminal needed.

    ```
    What are all the available configurations for the Supermemory plugin advanced mode?
    ```

    The agent will list every option. Then tell it what you want:

    ```
    Set up my Supermemory plugin with these settings:
    - Auto recall: true
    - Auto capture: true
    - Enable custom container tags: true
    - Custom containers:
      - work: Work-related memories from Slack and Gmail
      - personal: Personal memories from Telegram and WhatsApp
    - Custom instructions: When on Slack or Gmail, use the work container.
      When on Telegram or WhatsApp, use the personal container.
    ```

    Each custom container needs a **tag** and a **description** — e.g. `work: Work-related memories from Slack and Gmail`. The description helps the AI understand what belongs in that container.

    <Tip>
    You can change settings anytime by just telling the agent. For example: "Add a new container called `twitter-bookmarks` with description `Twitter bookmarks saved from Twitter` and make it read-only".
    </Tip>
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="All my session memories go into one container. How can I separate them by channel?">
    By default, all session memories across every channel are stored under a single root-level container tag.

    To store specific memories separately, use **custom container tags** — see the FAQ above on separating work and personal memories.

    Automatic per-channel separation is not supported yet. If you need this, let us know — with enough requests, we'll implement it right away.

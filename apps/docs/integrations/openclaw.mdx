<Warning>
This integration requires the **Supermemory Pro plan**. [Upgrade here](https://console.supermemory.ai/billing).
</Warning>

[OpenClaw](https://github.com/supermemoryai/openclaw-supermemory) is a multi-platform AI messaging gateway that connects to WhatsApp, Telegram, Discord, Slack, iMessage, and other messaging channels. The Supermemory plugin gives OpenClaw memory across every channel.

## Install the Plugin

Get started by installing the plugin with a single command.

```bash
openclaw plugins install @supermemory/openclaw-supermemory
```

Restart OpenClaw after installing.

## Setup

Run the setup command and enter your API key when prompted.

```bash
openclaw supermemory setup
```

Enter your API key from [console.supermemory.ai](https://console.supermemory.ai). That's it.

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Advanced Setup">
    Configure all options interactively with the advanced setup command:

    ```bash
    openclaw supermemory setup-advanced
    ```

    This lets you configure: container tag, auto-recall, auto-capture, capture mode, custom container tags, and more.

    See [Configuration Options](#configuration-options) for all available settings.

## How It Works

Once installed, the plugin runs automatically with zero interaction.

- **Auto-Recall** — Before every AI turn, Supermemory is queried for relevant memories and the user's profile. These are injected as context so the AI sees preferences, facts, and semantically similar past conversations.
- **Auto-Capture** — After every AI turn, the conversation exchange is sent to Supermemory for extraction and long-term storage. Supermemory handles deduplication and profile building.
- **Custom Container Tags** — When enabled via advanced setup, define custom memory containers (e.g., `work`, `personal`, `bookmarks`). The AI automatically picks the right container based on your instructions.

## Features

### AI Tools

The AI can use these tools autonomously during conversations.

| Tool | Description |
|------|-------------|
| `supermemory_store` | Save information to long-term memory. |
| `supermemory_search` | Search memories by query with similarity scores. |
| `supermemory_forget` | Delete a memory by query or ID. |
| `supermemory_profile` | View the user profile — persistent facts and recent context. |

### Slash Commands

Users can interact with memory directly in chat.

| Command | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| `/remember [text]` | Manually save something to memory. |
| `/recall [query]` | Search memories and see results with similarity scores. |

### CLI Commands

Manage your memory from the terminal.

```bash
openclaw supermemory setup              # Configure API key
openclaw supermemory setup-advanced     # Configure all options
openclaw supermemory status             # View current configuration
openclaw supermemory search <query>     # Search memories
openclaw supermemory profile            # View user profile
openclaw supermemory wipe               # Delete all memories (requires confirmation)
```

## Quick Install (Recommended)

```bash
npx -y install-mcp@latest https://mcp.supermemory.ai/mcp --client claude --oauth=yes
```

Replace `claude` with your MCP client: `cursor`, `windsurf`, `vscode`, etc.

## Manual Configuration

Add this to your MCP client config (Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf, etc.):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "supermemory": {
      "url": "https://mcp.supermemory.ai/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

The server uses **OAuth authentication** by default. Your MCP client will automatically discover the authorization server via `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource` and prompt you to authenticate.

## API Key Authentication (Alternative)

If you prefer to use an API key instead of OAuth, get one from [app.supermemory.ai](https://app.supermemory.ai) and pass it in the `Authorization` header:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "supermemory": {
      "url": "https://mcp.supermemory.ai/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "Authorization": "Bearer sm_your_api_key_here"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

API keys start with `sm_` and are automatically detected. When an API key is provided, OAuth authentication is skipped.

## Project Scoping (Optional)

To scope all operations to a specific project, add the `x-sm-project` header:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "supermemory": {
      "url": "https://mcp.supermemory.ai/mcp",
      "headers": {
        "x-sm-project": "your-project-id"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

This keeps memories organized by project, useful when working on multiple codebases or contexts.

## Client-Specific Setup

### Claude Desktop

Add to `~/Library/Application Support/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json` (macOS) or `%APPDATA%\Claude\claude_desktop_config.json` (Windows):

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "supermemory": {
      "url": "https://mcp.supermemory.ai/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

### Cursor

Add to `~/.cursor/mcp.json`:

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "supermemory": {
      "url": "https://mcp.supermemory.ai/mcp"
    }
  }
}
```

Or use the one-click install button at [app.supermemory.ai](https://app.supermemory.ai).

### Windsurf / VS Code

Configuration varies by extension. Generally, add the server URL (`https://mcp.supermemory.ai/mcp`) to your MCP settings.

## Using the MCP Server

Once configured, the MCP server provides three main tools:

### `memory` Tool

Save or forget information about the user:

```json
{
  "content": "User prefers dark mode and uses TypeScript",
  "action": "save",
  "containerTag": "optional-project-tag"
}
```

The AI assistant will automatically use this tool when:
- You explicitly ask it to remember something
- It detects important preferences or patterns in conversation

### `recall` Tool

Search memories and get user profile:

```json
{
  "query": "What are the user's programming preferences?",
  "includeProfile": true,
  "containerTag": "optional-project-tag"
}
```

The AI assistant will automatically use this tool when:
- You ask about past conversations or preferences
- It needs context from previous interactions
- It wants to provide personalized responses

### `whoAmI` Tool

Get information about the current logged-in user:

```json
{}
```

Returns your userId, email, name, client information, and sessionId.

## Resources

The MCP server also provides resources that can be accessed directly:

- **`supermemory://profile`** - Your user profile with stable preferences and recent activity
- **`supermemory://projects`** - List of your available memory projects

## Prompts

The server provides a `context` prompt that injects your user profile and preferences into the system context, allowing the AI to be aware of your preferences from the start of each conversation.

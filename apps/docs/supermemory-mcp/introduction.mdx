---

Supermemory MCP Server 4.0 is a standalone MCP server that gives AI assistants persistent memory across conversations. Built on Cloudflare Workers with Durable Objects, it serves as a universal memory layer enabling Large Language Models (LLMs) to maintain context and memories across different applications and sessions, solving the fundamental limitation of AI assistants forgetting everything between conversations.

## What Supermemory MCP Does

**Supermemory MCP** functions as a universal memory system that bridges AI applications through the [Model Context Protocol (MCP)](https://modelcontextprotocol.io). It operates as an **MCP server** that communicates with MCP-compatible clients, storing and retrieving contextual information through the Supermemory API infrastructure.

When users interact with any connected AI application, the system captures relevant information and makes it available across all other connected platforms through **semantic search and intelligent retrieval**.

### Supported Platforms

- **Claude Desktop** - Direct MCP protocol support
- **Cursor IDE** - Global MCP server configuration via `~/.cursor/mcp.json`
- **Windsurf** - Seamless integration for AI-powered development
- **VS Code** - Compatible with AI coding extensions
- **Cline/Roo-Cline** - Full MCP protocol support
- **Any MCP-compatible application** - Universal compatibility through standard protocol

### Key Features

- **Dual Authentication** - OAuth by default with API key alternative for automation
- **Persistent Memory** - Save and recall information across sessions using the `memory` tool
- **User Profiles** - Auto-generated profiles from stored memories with static and dynamic facts
- **Project Scoping** - Organize memories by project with `x-sm-project` header
- **Resources** - Access user profiles and project lists via MCP resources
- **Prompts** - System context injection with user preferences

## Core Workflow

1. User interacts with any MCP-compatible AI client
2. The client connects to `https://mcp.supermemory.ai/mcp`
3. OAuth flow authenticates the user (or API key validates directly)
4. During conversations, relevant information is stored using the `memory` tool
5. When context is needed, the `recall` tool retrieves relevant memories with hybrid search
6. The AI assistant accesses this persistent context regardless of which platform is being used

## Tools

### `memory`

Save or forget information about the user. Replaces the old `addToSupermemory` tool.

**Parameters:**
- `content` (string, required) - The memory content to save or forget
- `action` (`"save"` | `"forget"`, optional) - Default: `"save"`
- `containerTag` (string, optional) - Project tag to scope the memory

### `recall`

Search memories and get user profile. Replaces the old `searchSupermemory` tool.

**Parameters:**
- `query` (string, required) - Search query to find relevant memories
- `includeProfile` (boolean, optional) - Include user profile summary. Default: `true`
- `containerTag` (string, optional) - Project tag to scope the search

### `whoAmI`

Get the current logged-in user's information including userId, email, name, client, and sessionId.

## Resources

- `supermemory://profile` - User profile with stable preferences and recent activity
- `supermemory://projects` - List of available memory projects

## Prompts

- `context` - User profile and preferences for system context injection

## Security and Privacy

### Authentication Model

- **OAuth by default** - Secure authentication through Supermemory accounts with automatic discovery via `/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource`
- **API key alternative** - Keys start with `sm_` for programmatic access and automation
- **Session isolation** - Complete user data separation per account using Durable Objects

### Privacy Features

- **Data isolation** - User memories completely separated by account
- **Secure infrastructure** - Built on Cloudflare's enterprise-grade platform with Durable Objects
- **Open source** - Full transparency into how your data is handled

## 🎉 Added

### SDK Enhancements

<Card title="OpenAI Middleware for Python SDK" icon="python" href="https://github.com/supermemoryai/supermemory/pull/546">
Python developers can now integrate Supermemory directly with OpenAI's Python SDK through middleware functionality. This enables automatic memory capture and retrieval in your AI applications without manual API calls.
</Card>

- **OpenAI Responses API Support in TypeScript SDK** ([#549](https://github.com/supermemoryai/supermemory/pull/549)) - Added support for OpenAI's Responses API in the TypeScript SDK, allowing seamless integration with the latest OpenAI features.

### Browser Extension

- **Markdown Conversion for Webpage Capture** ([#548](https://github.com/supermemoryai/supermemory/pull/548)) - When saving entire webpages, content is now automatically converted to clean markdown format. The extension intelligently prioritizes content types (explicit content, highlighted text, markdown, HTML, or URL) and removes script tags for cleaner storage.

### User Experience

- **Inline Chat Deletion Confirmation** ([#581](https://github.com/supermemoryai/supermemory/pull/581)) - Added inline confirmation dialog when deleting chats, preventing accidental deletions and improving the user workflow.

- **Skeleton Loading States** ([#541](https://github.com/supermemoryai/supermemory/pull/541)) - Replaced simple loading spinners with skeleton loading cards in the memory list, providing better visual feedback while content loads.

## 🔄 Changed

### Infrastructure

<Warning>
**Major Upgrade:** This release includes Next.js 16, which brings significant performance improvements and new capabilities.
</Warning>

- **Upgraded to Next.js 16** ([#557](https://github.com/supermemoryai/supermemory/pull/557)) - Major framework upgrade bringing improved performance, better caching strategies, and access to the latest React features. This lays the foundation for future performance optimizations.

- **Migrated Chat Storage from localStorage to IndexedDB** ([#560](https://github.com/supermemoryai/supermemory/pull/560)) - Chat persistence now uses IndexedDB instead of localStorage, eliminating `QuotaExceededError` issues for users with large chat histories. This allows virtually unlimited chat storage without browser limitations.

### Browser Extension

- **Replaced Chrome Storage API with WXT Storage API** ([#566](https://github.com/supermemoryai/supermemory/pull/566)) - Modernized the extension's storage layer for better cross-browser compatibility and improved performance.

- **Optimized Icon Fetching for Bookmarks** ([#496](https://github.com/supermemoryai/supermemory/pull/496)) - Fixed excessive icon refetch operations when importing bookmarks, significantly reducing API calls and improving import performance.

### UI/UX Improvements

- **Enhanced Mobile Chat Interface** ([#541](https://github.com/supermemoryai/supermemory/pull/541)) - Improved responsive padding, header layout with proper text truncation, and better message container width constraints on mobile devices.

- **Improved Chat Messages Scroll Behavior** ([#544](https://github.com/supermemoryai/supermemory/pull/544)) - Fixed scroll effects in chat messages for smoother conversation navigation.

- **Model Selector Hydration Fix** ([#568](https://github.com/supermemoryai/supermemory/pull/568)) - Resolved hydration issues on the model selector and added the ability to display the currently selected model in chat.

### Documentation

- **Updated README with Recent Features** ([#547](https://github.com/supermemoryai/supermemory/pull/547)) - Comprehensive README update including light/dark mode compatible logo, developer resources section, detailed Browser Extension and Raycast Extension sections, and updated screenshots.

- **Personal Assistant Cookbook Updates** ([#575](https://github.com/supermemoryai/supermemory/pull/575)) - Enhanced cookbook documentation for building personal assistants with Supermemory.

- **Improved API Endpoint Documentation** ([#550](https://github.com/supermemoryai/supermemory/pull/550)) - Better documentation for the `document/by-id` endpoint with additional warnings based on user questions.

- **Self-Hosting Link Added to README** ([#573](https://github.com/supermemoryai/supermemory/pull/573)) - Added clear documentation for self-hosting Supermemory.

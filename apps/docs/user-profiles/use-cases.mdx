## Personalized AI Assistants

The most common use case: building AI assistants that truly know your users.

**What profiles provide:**
- User's expertise level (adjust technical depth)
- Communication preferences (brief vs detailed, formal vs casual)
- Tools and technologies they use
- Current projects and priorities

**Example prompt enhancement:**

```typescript
const systemPrompt = `You are assisting ${userName}.

Their background:
${profile.static.join('\n')}

Current focus:
${profile.dynamic.join('\n')}

Adjust your responses to match their expertise level and preferences.`;
```

**Result:** An assistant that explains React hooks differently to a junior developer vs a senior architect.

## Customer Support Systems

Give support agents (or AI) instant context about customers.

**What profiles provide:**
- Customer's product usage history
- Previous issues and resolutions
- Preferred communication channels
- Technical proficiency level

**Benefits:**
- No more "let me look up your account"
- Agents immediately understand customer context
- AI support can reference past interactions naturally

```typescript
// Support agent dashboard
async function loadCustomerContext(customerId: string) {
  const { profile } = await getProfile(customerId);

  return {
    summary: profile.static,      // Long-term customer info
    recentIssues: profile.dynamic // Current tickets, recent problems
  };
}
```

## Educational Platforms

Adapt learning content to each student's level and progress.

**What profiles provide:**
- Learning style preferences
- Completed courses and topics
- Areas of strength and weakness
- Current learning goals

**Example adaptation:**

```typescript
// Profile might contain:
// static: ["Visual learner", "Strong in algebra, struggles with geometry"]
// dynamic: ["Currently studying calculus", "Preparing for AP exam"]

const tutorPrompt = `You're helping a student with:
${profile.static.join('\n')}

Current focus: ${profile.dynamic.join('\n')}

Adapt explanations to their learning style and build on their strengths.`;
```

## Development Tools

IDE assistants and coding tools that understand your codebase and habits.

**What profiles provide:**
- Preferred languages and frameworks
- Coding style and conventions
- Current project context
- Frequently used patterns

**Example:**

```typescript
// Profile for a developer:
// static: ["Prefers TypeScript", "Uses functional patterns", "Senior engineer"]
// dynamic: ["Working on auth refactor", "Recently learning Rust"]

// Code assistant knows to:
// - Suggest TypeScript solutions
// - Use functional patterns in examples
// - Provide senior-level explanations
// - Connect suggestions to the auth refactor when relevant
```

## Knowledge Base Assistants

Internal tools that understand each employee's role and responsibilities.

**What profiles provide:**
- Department and role
- Projects they're involved in
- Access level and permissions context
- Areas of expertise (for routing questions)

**Example:**

```typescript
// HR assistant that knows:
// - Employee's team and manager
// - Their location/timezone
// - Recent PTO requests
// - Benefits elections

const response = await hrAssistant.answer(
  "When is my next performance review?",
  { profile: employeeProfile }
);
// Can answer with specific dates, manager name, etc.
```

## E-commerce Recommendations

Personalized shopping experiences beyond basic recommendation engines.

**What profiles provide:**
- Style preferences
- Size information
- Past purchases and returns
- Budget range
- Occasions they shop for

**Example conversation:**

```
User: "I need something for a wedding next month"

// Profile knows: prefers classic styles, size M, budget-conscious,
// previously bought navy suits
